# advanced reverse shell
This project is a reverse shell implementation with added error handling for seamless execution. Modifications include incorporating try-except blocks for handling errors related to importing psutil and gputil modules. This adjustment resolves potential issues encountered due to missing disutils module dependencies. The project aims to provide a reliable and robust reverse shell functionality while ensuring smooth execution across different environments. You can test it in your Virtual machine such as Linux. If you have any other ways you can contribute to the code, it will be helpful.
